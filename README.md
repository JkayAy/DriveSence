Smart City Vehicle Detection System
Overview
The Smart City Vehicle Detection System is an innovative, data-driven solution designed to support urban traffic management by identifying vehicles, detecting license plates, and monitoring traffic violations, specifically speed infringements. Powered by YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and OCR for license plate recognition, this system collects and processes data from traffic streams, reports violations, and enables seamless integration with a sophisticated backend for data storage and analytics. The frontend is developed using Dash, providing an intuitive, interactive interface for traffic data visualization.

Features
Real-Time Vehicle Detection: Utilizes YOLOv8 to identify and track vehicles on the road in real time.
License Plate Recognition: Integrates OCR capabilities to capture and log license plate information.
Violation Detection and Reporting: Detects speed violations and logs them with timestamp, location, and vehicle details.
Comprehensive Data Analytics: Backend system enables data storage, violation tracking, and analytics for enhanced traffic management.
User Management: Provides a secure registration and login system for administrators and city traffic officers.
Project Structure
The project is organized into distinct modules for modular development and deployment:

Technologies Used
Backend: Flask, SQLAlchemy for ORM, RESTful API design.
Frontend: Dash for interactive data visualization.
Detection: YOLOv8 for object detection, OpenCV for image processing, Tesseract OCR for license plate recognition.
Database: SQLite (or any preferred relational database).
Environment: Python 3.8+
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-city-vehicle-detection.git
cd smart-city-vehicle-detection
Set up virtual environments for the backend, frontend, and detection modules to isolate dependencies.

Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Initialize the database:

python
Copy code
from app import db
db.create_all()
Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
flask run
The backend API should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install the frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Dash application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The frontend should now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8050.

Detection Module Setup
In another terminal, navigate to the detection directory:

bash
Copy code
cd detection
Install the detection dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the detection script:

bash
Copy code
python detection.py
This will activate YOLOv8 to start identifying vehicles and recognizing license plates from a live or recorded video feed.

Database Configuration
The database uses SQLAlchemy for an ORM setup. Modify the database URI in backend/database.py if using a database other than SQLite. For SQLite, a violations.db file will be created automatically.

Deployment
To deploy this project on a local or cloud server:

Set up a production server (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS, or any preferred cloud service).
Install Docker for containerization (optional but recommended).
Configure environment variables in .env files for security.
Run the application in a production environment using gunicorn or another WSGI server.
For production deployment, configure a load balancer and secure the API endpoints with HTTPS.

Usage
Access the Dashboard
The frontend Dash app serves as an interactive dashboard where users can:

Visualize real-time traffic data.
Review and manage violations.
Generate and export reports.
